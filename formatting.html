    <h1>Thought : Avoid using chat GPT while learnig, use more and more doc.</h1>
    <h1>Formmating</h1>
    <h3>NOTE 1:</h3> cmd/command + / : multi line comment 
    <p>the commented lines are not vissible on the scren but can be seen in the code in inspect code <br>
    best practice is not tu put any sensitive informationin comments like userID and Password</p>
     
    <h2>Text Formatting</h2>
    <p>this is <b>bold</b></p> <small>draw attention without telling the browser its important</small>
    <p>this is <strong>strong</strong></p> <small>represent someting important, serious, urgent</small>
    <h3>NOTE 2:</h3>
    <p>Eariler there was not much CSS so bold tag is used to styling the tsxt 
    but now we dont follow that approch . For styling we have CSS. <br>
    We only use strong tag when we need to highlight a phraser to SEO <br>
ex. in new some part of line are bold which are meant for google to show in suggestion whn user shearch <br>
somthing related to that topic </p>
    <h3>Assinement: Typograpghy</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>i <small>text set off from normal pose used for <i>frictional charecter name, quote, etc </i> </small> <br> em <small>used to <em>emphasise the text</em></small> </li>
        <li>small <small>hello</small></li> used fo rside coment and small print  ex. copywrite and legal text 
        <li>sub CO<sub>2</sub> <br> sup OH<sup>-</sup> </li> used for subscript and superscripting 
        <li>
            del <small>used to display the updated value over <del>old value </del></small> 
            <br>
             mar <small>mark the text <mark>text of interest </mark>, it is used to highlight the relevent data to the heading </small>
            </li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Assinement: what is the difference between em and strong</h3>
    <small>While <em> is used to change the meaning of a sentence as spoken emphasis does ("I love carrots" vs. "I love carrots"), <strong> is used to give portions of a sentence added importance (e.g., "Warning! This is very dangerous.") Both <strong> and <em> can be nested to increase the relative degree of importance or stress emphasis, respectively. </small>
    <h3>Best Practise while using inline styling </h3>
    <h3 
    style="
    color: aqua;
    background-color: #040404;
    "
    > This tag need some styling </h3>
    <h3>Assinement</h3>
        <p>check different properties of the styling in mdn doc. 
            list the golbal attributes( which can be universally used with all the tags ex.title    )
            tell me where you have used While <em> is used to change the meaning of a sentence as spoken emphasis does ("I love carrots" vs. "I love carrots"), <strong> is used to give portions of a sentence added importance (e.g., "Warning! This is very dangerous.") Both <strong> and <em> can be nested to increase the relative degree of importance or stress emphasis, respectively.̉̉̉
